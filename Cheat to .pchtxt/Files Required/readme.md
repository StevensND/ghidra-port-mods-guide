### What we will need:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Interactive-ASM-Cheats-Updater ](https://github.com/zzpong/Interactive-ASM-Cheats-Updater/releases)
- [ips+pchtxt2cheat.py](https://github.com/StevensND/ghidra-port-mods-guide/blob/main/Cheat%20to%20.pchtxt/Files%20Required/ips%2Bpchtxt2cheat.py)
- [hexreverser.py](https://github.com/StevensND/ghidra-port-mods-guide/blob/main/Cheat%20to%20.pchtxt/Files%20Required/hexreverser.py)
- [Ryujinx](https://ryujinx.org/download/) to extract the ExeFS files. You can do it with Yuzu too but IMO Ryujinx do a better job and itâ€™s more faster. We need the main file.
- [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) or any other Hex Editor like [this one](https://hexed.it/) (online version)
- [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) It's not really necessary but IMO it's more convenient compared to Windows Notepad
-	**Update the cheat was developed for**
-	**Any other update (we will use it as a bypass)**
