>[!NOTE]
This guide is **made for real hardware**, not emulators.

So yeah ... You can only follow this guide if you own a Switch with access to homebrew apps.

## Requirements

- Switch with access to homebrew apps.

- SaltyNX

- **Optional**: ReverseNX-Tool

- **You must have**: ReverseNX

- Ultrahand/Uberhand

- Status Monitor

- Edizon (App + Overlay)

>[!TIP]
You can use [this guide](https://rentry.co/howtoget60fps) to learn how to setup all of this tools.

However I suggest you to use a pack. In my case I'm using [NXVenom Pack](https://github.com/CatcherITGF/NX-Venom/) that already include all of this.
