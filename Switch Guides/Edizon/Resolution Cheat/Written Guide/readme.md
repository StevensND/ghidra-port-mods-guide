**Optional**: Open ReverseNX-Tool and make the game run at Handheld by default.

As I said, this step is optional. Open the homebrew menu and run Reverse-NX Tool.

For this tutorial, I'm going to mod Hollow Knight: Silksong resolution.

Now select the game, press A, scroll up with the arrows and select Handheld. Then press A.

Check that the game now says Handheld instead of System.

Now run the game, load your save and open Ultrahand/Uberhand by pressing `ZL + ZR + DPAD DOWN` simultaneously to access to the overlay.

Now select `Status Monitor`, press A, scroll down until `Game Resolutions` and press A.

You will see the Game Resolutions Overlay.

By default, Silksong runs at 1024x576 on Handheld. Press the HOME button and open the homebrew menu again.

Run Edizon SE.

Now press L to be able to move between the options.

Be sure that:

```

MODE is set to ==
REGION is set to HEAP + MAIN
```

Now press R again and set the `VALUE`. In this case 576. After that, move to `Search Now!` and press A.
