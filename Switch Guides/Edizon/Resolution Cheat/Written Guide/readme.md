**Optional**: Open ReverseNX-Tool and make the game run at Handheld by default.

As I said, this step is optional. Open the homebrew menu and run Reverse-NX Tool.

Check that the game now says Handheld instead of System.

Now run the game, load your save and open Ultrahand/Uberhand by pressing `ZL + ZR + DPAD DOWN` simultaneously to access to the overlay.

Now select `Status Monitor`, press A, scroll down until `Game Resolutions` and press A.

You will see the Game Resolutions Overlay.

Go back to the game, open Ultrahand/Uberhand overlay and select `ReverseNX-RT`. 

Controlled by system will be set on: `Yes`. Select `Change system control` and press A to change it to `No`

Then, select `Change Mode` and press A. This will change the mode from `Handheld` to `Docked` just like the pic below shows.
