## Offline ARMConverter

In case that the [ARMConverter](https://armconverter.com/) website is not working, here's an alternative.

Go to this [Github Repository](https://github.com/MikaCybertron/ARM-Converter) and download the files by clicking on `Code` and then `Download zip`

Save the files somewhere and then extract the files.

Finally just run the .exe file.

I also leave the files uploaded in case you need them. Click on the .zip file and finally click on View Raw to start the download.
