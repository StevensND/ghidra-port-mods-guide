- **[Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/)**: We need Cheat Engine to find the addresses that modify the Aspect Ratio of the game.

- **[Cheat Engine 7.5 AD-Free](https://www.reddit.com/user/ChucksFeedAndSeed/comments/12usdd5/cheat_engine_75_adfree_installer/)**: Use this in case you don't want ads.

- **[GDB-Multiarch](https://static.grumpycoder.net/pixel/gdb-multiarch-windows/)**: Thanks to the combo of CE + GDB we will be able to find our final address for Ghidra/IDA as well as modify the Aspect Ratio in real time. So **using GDB is very important** for this guide.
