Here you will find scripts that you should use for some specific games such as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.

The reason for using these scripts instead of the normal `3.GDBtoGHIDRA.py` script is that **some games don't use `7100000000` as Base Address**.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe use `60000000` instead of `7100000000` so if you use the `3.GDBtoGHIDRA.py` script you would not get a working Ghidra Address.
