# Steps to do in Ryujinx

I assume you already know how to setup Ryujinx: Setup prod.keys, firmware and set up your game folder directory so I won’t explain it. Otherwise use [this guide](https://github.com/Abd-007/Switch-Emulators-Guide/blob/main/Ryujinx.md) or this [video guide](https://youtu.be/a3lqX176K0w?t=110) so ... let's continue:

1. Right click on the game you want -> Manage Title Updates -> Add and search for the update. Make sure you only select the update you want to extract the ExeFS files from.
Remember that you will need 2 versions (the old one and the new one) and if you want to learn how everything works better, a third one (previous to these 2) so you can compare what changes between the three versions.

2. Right click on the game again and click on Extract Data ->  ExeFS. Select a folder where you want to save these files and wait until it’s done. Then close Ryujinx. You no longer need it for the rest of this guide.
