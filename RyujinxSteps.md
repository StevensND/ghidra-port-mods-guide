# Steps to do in Ryujinx

I assume you already know how to setup Ryujinx: Setup prod.keys, firmware and set up your game folder directory so I won’t explain it. Otherwise use [this guide](https://github.com/Abd-007/Switch-Emulators-Guide/blob/main/Ryujinx.md) or this [video guide](https://youtu.be/a3lqX176K0w?t=110) so ... let's continue:

1. Right click on the game you want -> Manage Title Updates -> Add and search for the update. Make sure you only select the update you want to extract the ExeFS files from.
Remember that you will need 2 versions (the old one and the new one) and if you want to learn how everything works better, a third one (previous to these 2. This is just for starters. If you have more experience with Ghidra you just need 2) so you can compare what changes between the three versions.

2. Right click on the game again and click on Extract Data ->  ExeFS. Select a folder where you want to save these files and wait until it’s done. Then close Ryujinx. You no longer need it for the rest of this guide.
